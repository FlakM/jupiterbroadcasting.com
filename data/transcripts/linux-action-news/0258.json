Shikitega alters its code each time it runs through one of several decoding loops that AT&amp;T said each deliver multiple attacks, beginning with an ELF file that's just 370 bytes. </li><li><a href=\"https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/next-gen-linux-malware-takes-over-devices-unique-toolset\" title=\"Next-Gen Linux Malware Takes Over Devices With Unique Tool Set\" rel=\"nofollow\">Next-Gen Linux Malware Takes Over Devices With Unique Tool Set</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/news/OpenWrt-22.03-Released\" title=\"OpenWrt 22.03 Released With Updated Firewall, Support For 180+ New Devices - Phoronix\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenWrt 22.03 Released With Updated Firewall, Support For 180+ New Devices - Phoronix</a></li><li><a href=\"https://openwrt.org/releases/22.03/notes-22.03.0\" title=\"[OpenWrt Wiki] OpenWrt 22.03.0 - First Stable Release - 6 September 2022\" rel=\"nofollow\">[OpenWrt Wiki] OpenWrt 22.03.0 - First Stable Release - 6 September 2022</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-an-intent-to-form-the-openwallet-foundation\" title=\"Linux Foundation Announces Open Wallet Foundation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Linux Foundation Announces Open Wallet Foundation</a> &mdash; The Linux Foundation, a global nonprofit organization enabling innovation through open source, today announced the intention to form the OpenWallet Foundation (OWF), a new collaborative effort to develop open source software to support interoperability for a wide range of wallet use cases.</li><li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/13/linux-foundation-announces-the-openwallet-foundation-to-develop-interoperable-digital-wallets/\" title=\"Linux Foundation announces the OpenWallet Foundation to develop interoperable digital wallets\" rel=\"nofollow\">Linux Foundation announces the OpenWallet Foundation to develop interoperable digital wallets</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/welcoming-pytorch-to-the-linux-foundation\" title=\"Welcoming PyTorch to the Linux Foundation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Welcoming PyTorch to the Linux Foundation</a></li><li><a href=\"https://debugpointnews.com/meta-pytorch-linux/\" title=\"Facebook Transfers PyTorch AI Framework to Linux Foundation for Governance\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook Transfers PyTorch AI Framework to Linux Foundation for Governance</a> &mdash; Today we are more than thrilled to welcome PyTorch to the Linux Foundation.
